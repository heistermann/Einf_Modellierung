description: >
   Compute the direct runoff response (in *m3/s*) to a precipitation event using the unit-hydrograph model!
   
       **Attention R-users:** The concept of a list in R is different from languages such as Python. In order to make this work here, you need to first `unlist` any required input vector `v`.
    
    ```
        v = unlist(v)
    ```
    #### Example
   
   Let the unit hydrograph be `uhg = [0.2, 0.8]`, the time series of hourly effective rainfall (in *mm/h*) be
   `precip = [2, 4]`, and the catchment area (in *km²*) 
   `area = 7.2`. Hence, the response hydrograph is `3` hours long and takes the values of `[0.8, 4.8, 6.4]`.
    
input1:
   name: precip
   type: array.float
   description: Hourly effective precipitation (mm/h)

input2:
   name: uhg
   type: array.float
   description: vector representing the unit hydrograph 

input3:
   name: area
   type: float
   description: catchment area (km²) 
   
output:
   type: array.float
   description: hydrograph of direct runoff (m³/s)

test1:
   input: 
   - [2, 6]
   - [0.2, 0.5, 0.3]
   - 3.6
   output: [0.4, 2.2, 3.6, 1.8]

test2:
   input: 
   - [3, 10, 5]
   - [0.1, 0.6, 0.2, 0.1]
   - 7.2
   output: [0.6, 5.6, 14.2, 10.6, 4.0, 1.0]

test3:
   input: 
   - [6, 3, 4]
   - [0.2, 0.5, 0.3]
   - 10.8
   output: [3.6, 10.8, 12.3, 8.7, 3.6]

solution: >
   x5_uhg3 = function(precip, uhg, area) {
      precip = unlist(precip)
      uhg = unlist(uhg)
      out = rep(0, length(precip) + length(uhg) - 1)
     for (i in 1:length(precip)) {
   	ix = i:(i+length(uhg)-1)
   	out[ix] = out[ix] + precip[i] * uhg * area / 3.6
     }  
     return(out)
   }
